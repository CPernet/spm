function spike = ft_datatype_spikeraw(spike, varargin)

% FT_DATATYPE_SPIKERAW describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for raw spike data
%
% Spike data is characterised as a sparse point-process, i.e. each neuronal
% firing is only represented as the time at which the firing happened.
% Optionally, the spike waveform can also be represented. Using the spike
% waveform, the neuronal firing events can be sorted into their single units.
%
% Spike data is obtained using FT_READ_SPIKE to read it from a Plexon,
% Neuralynx or other animal electrophysiology system file format containing
% spikes.
%
% An example spike data structure is:
%
%         label: {'chan1', 'chan2', 'chan3'}                         the channel labels
%     timestamp: {[1x993 uint64]  [1x423 uint64]  [1x3424 uint64]}   timestamp in arbitrary units, depends on the acquisition system
%      waveform: {[32x993 double] [32x433 double] [32x3424 double]}  spike waveform, here described with 32 samples
%           hdr: [1x1 struct]                                        the full header information of the original dataset on disk
%
% Required fields:
