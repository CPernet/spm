function [brain, skull, scalp] = validate_seg(brain, skull, scalp)

% VALIDATE_SEG ensures that the segmentation represents three tissue types
% that are overlapping rather than exclusive.
%
% Use as
%   [brain, skull, scalp] = validate_segmentation(brain, skull, scalp)
% where the skull and scalp input (and output) arguments are optional.
%
% The output will consist of three overlapping boolean segmentations. If
% the input is invalid and cannot be converted to overlapping
% segmentations, this function will give an error.
