% FT_PREAMBLE_PROVENANCE is a helper script that records the time and memory at the
% start of the function. This is to be used together with FT_POSTAMBLE_PROVENANCE which
% will record and store the time and memory at the end of the function. This is
% stored in the output configuration together with information about the enbvironment,
% such as the name of the user and computer, the matlab and fieldtrip version, etc.
%
% Another aspects of provenance relates to uniquely identifying the input and the
% output data. The code that deals with tracking the information about the input data
% structures is found in ft_preamble_loadvar. The code that deals with tracking the
% information about the output data structures is found in ft_preamble_history.
