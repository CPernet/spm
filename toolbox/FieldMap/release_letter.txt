Dear everyone,

In keeping with the proud tradition of e.g. SPM2 we are happy
to announce the release of the FieldMap toolbox, no more than
a year or so too late.

It consists of two parts; i) FieldMap which is a tool for 
creation and unwrapping of fieldmaps to use for distortion
correction of EPI (fMRI) images. ii) A revised version of 
Unwarp that combines the estimation of maps of the rate of
change of the field w.r.t. subject movement with a measured
fieldmap. This fieldmap could have been created any which
way as long as the input format is correct, something which
is automatically guaranteed if FieldMap is used.

FieldMap comes with a graphical user interface that we hope
shall help users not only to calculate fieldmaps but also 
gain an understanding of the effects of susceptibility-
induced distortions and the parameters that affect it. It
also has a "scripting interface" that will allow users to 
automate the creation of fieldmaps once a routine has been
established at the individual site.

This version of Unwarp should also solve the problems that 
have been reported by Windows users.

We have tried to accomodate the different ways in which 
fieldmaps (EPI or non-EPI based, real_&_imaginary or 
phase_&_magnitude etc) and EPI (e.g. different blip
directions) can be acquired. We have tried or best to test
and validate all the different combinations, but needless
to say there will be bugs in the first release. All the 
usual waivers apply; "We can not be held responsible for
any damage resulting from the use of...", "We hear voices 
in our heads and only do as they tell us" etc etc.

The FieldMap toolbox and the updated version can be found
at http://. There will also be extensive help-files (.man) for
both and a description how to install then (installation.txt).

Good luck Chloe & Jesper
